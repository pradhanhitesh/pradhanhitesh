Passionate neuroscientist dedicated to unraveling neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's. From a chance encounter with "Alzheimer's" in 2016, I've evolved into a committed researcher. My expertise lies in developing early AD prediction frameworks, utilizing neuroimaging and explainable AI models. Currently, at the Centre for Brain Research, I explore population-level dynamics in rural India, decoding brain pathological changes associated with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Join me in this exciting journey as we make a lasting impact on dementia research.

🔨 I am currently ..
```yaml
1. Developing 3D brain MRI transformation techniques for efficient CNN models
2. Working on brain-age prediction models for early biomarkers of dementia
```
